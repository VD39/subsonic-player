## üöÄ Installation Methods

**Prerequisites:**

- [Docker][docker] (recommended).
- [Node.js][nodejs] 20+.
- [Yarn][yarn].

### Method 1: Docker Deployment

### Docker Compose Configuration

The simplest way to run the application is via Docker Compose. This method automatically handles dependencies and configuration.

The [environment variables][env-vars] are optional and can be customized as needed.

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following content.

```yml
services:
  subsonic-player:
    container_name: subsonic-player
    image: vd39/subsonic-player:latest
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Docker Run Command (Alternative)

This method offers more granular control.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name subsonic-player \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  vd39/subsonic-player:latest
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Method 2: Local Development

This method skips Docker and runs the application directly using Node.js and Yarn.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VD39/subsonic-player.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd subsonic-player
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **(Optional)** Create a `.env` file: Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory. This file will hold your [environment variables][env-vars].

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

Changes you make to the code will automatically trigger a rebuild and refresh of the browser.
